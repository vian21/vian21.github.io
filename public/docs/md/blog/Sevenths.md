# Seventh Chords

- Formula: 1-3-5-`7`
- They can be split into 2 chords to make up slash chords
- slash chords are when a chord is played with a different bass note i.e F#/D pronounced D over F which means a Dmaj chord with an F# in the bass.

There are 4 types of seventh chords:

1. Major seventh
1. Minor seventh
1. Dominant seventh
1. Diminished

- To make any seventh chord:
  - you take the third of a normal chord
  - play it as a triad

For example Do Maj7,

- Do-Mi-Sol
- Mi is the third of Do Maj
- So you play Mi as a chord which is Mi mineur
- so now you have Do / (Mi-Sol-Si)
- which is Do/Mi mineur or 1/3min
