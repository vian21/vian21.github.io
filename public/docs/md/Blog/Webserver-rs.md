## Notes
- Webserver relies on two protocals: TCP and HTTP
- `Transmission Control Protocol` (TCP) is a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network.
- TCP describes how data is sent from on host to another but does not specify what kind of information is sent
- HTTP builds on top of TCP and specifies what kind of information needs to be sent
- Both act as interfaces/guidelines that need to be implemented.
- HTTP can work TCP or another network protocal
