## TUT1

- git: popular medium-high complexity version control tool
- Version control: Management tools used to manage changes to files e.g git, SVN, mercurial

## why

- Isolates developers from one another while they work
- Allows for selective and predictable integration of different portions of a
  project

## Core concepts

- A repository contains:

  - files
  - history
  - special configuration

- Git has 2 local states
  - working directory: folder/directory on your computer that holds all the project's files
  - staging area: queue that holds changes for the next commit
  - Local repository: git repository on your local machine (.git folder)
- Remote repository:
- branch
- Main branch
- why use branches?
  -Allow simultaneous work on multiple features or fixes

  - Isolate changes without affecting the main project

- `origin/main`- origin is shorthand name for the remote repository

## Basic command

```sh
git add $filename # add file to staging area. if . , will include all untracked files to staging area
git revert $filename # revert a file in the staging area
git status #print the status of the staging area
git push # send changes to remote server
git branch $NAME #createa new branch
```

- Interface: an interface is a contract that stipulates what a class must have
- Abstract class: is a class that has at least one abstract method. An abstract class can not be instantiated
- Overriding: is when a subclass redefines a method from its superclass
- Overloading: is when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters
- dynamic binding: occurs when the decision about which method to run can only be made at runtime
- needed when:
  - a variable is declared to have a superclass as it type
  - there is more than one possible polymorphic method that could be run among the type of the variable and its subclass

### Wrapper class vs primitive type

Character c1 vs char c2

- Character c1 is a reference to an object of type Character and can contain functions that can be called on it. Character can also be used to instantiate a generic typed class.
- char c2 is a primitive type

### casting

- casting: is when you convert a variable from one type to another
- Types:
  - widening casting (automatic): converting a variable to a type that can hold a larger range of values. Automatic because you are not going to lose any data in the conversion
  - narrowing casting (): converting a variable to a type that can hold a smaller range of values

### Access modifiers

- public: accessible to all classes
- private: accessible only to the class itself
- protected: accessible to the class itself, its subclasses and classes in the same package
- default: accessible to the class itself and classes in the same package

### Exceptions

- Exception: a class with many subclasses for a specific type of error

- Package: combines related classes into subsystems

## Programming style guide

- always choose the simple alternative
- reject clever code that is hard to understand
- shorter code is not necessarily better
- Choose good names
  - make them highly descriptive
  - do not worry about long names

## Reusability

- Def: the ability to use existing code to create new software
- SOftware eng should avoid rewriting code that already exists

### Types of reuse

- Reuse of expertise
- reuse of standard designs and algorithms
- reuse of libraries of classes or procedures
- reuse of powerful commands built into a programming language and OS
- Reuse of frameworks
- reuse of complete applications

### Reusable components

- component: a self-contained, reusable software unit that can be combined with other components to create a larger software system
- Framework: a reusable software that implements a generic solution to a generalized problem
- Library:
- It provides common facilities applicable to different application programs
- principle: applications that do different but related things tend to have similar designs

- callbacks: functions that the frameworks calls withing the application code. It expects the application to provide the code for the callback functions
- The collection of services provided by the frameworks is called the framework API (Application Programming Interface)
- 2 types:
  - slots: callbacks that are mandatory by the framework. They are required by the framework but they are not implemented
  - hooks: optional callbacks.

### Object-oriented frameworks

- a frameworks is composed of a library of classes
- The API is the set of all public methods of theses classes

## Types of frameworks

- Horizontal frameworks: provides a large set of services that can be used by many different types of applications
- A vertical frameworks(application frameworks): is more complete but still requires slots to be implemented by the developer. It is more specialized for certain uses

### Client-server architecture

- A distributed system is a system in which:

  - computations are performed by separate programs
  - normally running on separate hardware
  - that cooperate to perform a task

- server: a program that provides a service to other programs
- client: a program that uses a service provided by a server
- How many threads are present in a scenerio of 1 server and 2 clients? 7 threads
  - Server (3)
    - 1 thread for listening for clients
    - 2 threads for handling the clients
  - Client (2):
    - 1 thread for user interface
    - 1 thread for sending messages

## Sequence of activities

1. Server starts its execution
2. Server waits for a client to connect
3. Client starts its execution
4. Client connects to the server which can accept or refuse the connection
5. The server waits to receive messages from the connected clients
6. when a message is received the server performs certain operation and then goes back to standby
7. The client and server repeat this process until the client decides to disconnect

### Activities of a server

1. Initializes itself
2. starts listening for clients
3. Handles the following types of events:

- client connection
- respond to messages
- handle client disconnection

4. May stop listening
5. Must cleanly terminate

## Activities of a client

1. Initializes itself
2. Initialize a connection to the server
3. sends mes c sages
4. handles the following types of events from the server:

- respond to message
- handle server disconnection

4. must cleanly terminate

- activity diagram: a diagram that shows the sequence of activities in a system
- State diagram: a state diagram is a diagram that shows the different states that an object can be in and the transitions between those states

# TUT 2 - Android 1

- Android is an open source mobile operating system based on Linux
- Android studio is the official IDE for android development and support Java and Kotlin

### AVD

- AVD - Android Virtual Device
  - An android device emulator configuration that specifies the characteristics of an android phone, tablet, Android TV or Wear OS device that you want to simulate in the Android Emulator
- Consists of:
  - Hardware profile: defines the characteristics of the virtual device i.e camera, screen size, resolution, CPU, RAM, storage, etc
  - system image: the android OS that runs on the virtual device
  - Dedicated storage on host computer
  - others e.g appearance, skins, network, etc

## Thin client vs fat client

- Thin client (cloud gaming):
  - client is made as small as possible
  - most of the processing is done on the server
  - client is easy to download over the network
- Fat client:
  - As much work as possible is handled on the client
  - server can handle more clients

## Communication protocol

- Protocol: a set of rules that governs the communication between two entities

### Task to perform to develop client-server application

1. design the primary work to be done on the client and server
2. design How will the work be distributed
3.
4. TODO

## OCSF - Object Client Server Framework

- "Soft eng using the OCSF never modify its three classes"

1. AbstractClient
2. AbstractServer
3. ConnectionToClient

- SOft eng :
  • Create subclasses of the abstract classes in the
  framework
  • Call public methods that are provided by the framework
  • Override certain slot and hook methods (explicitly
  designed to be overridden)

## CLient

- consists of a sing class : abstractClient
- must be subclasses:
  - any subclass must implement : `handleMessageFromServer`
  - implement the Runnable interface

## AbstractClient interface

- Controlling methods:
  - openConnection()
  - closeConnection()
  - sendToServer()
- Accessing methods:

  - isConnected()
  - getHost()
  - setHost()
  - getPort()
  - getInetAddress()

  ## Server

  - consists of two classes: AbstractServer and ConnectionToClient
  - AbstractServer: thread that listens for new connections
  - ConnectionToClient: one for the threads that handle a clients

### AbstractServer interface

- Controlling methods:
  - listen()
  - stopListening()
  - sendToAllClients()
  - close()
- Accessing methods:

  - isListening()
  - getClientConnections()
  - getPort
  - setPort()
  - setBacklog()

- methods may be overridden:
- serverStarted()
- serverStopped()
- clientConnected()
- clientDisconnected()
- clientException()
- listeningException()
- serverClosed()
- Methods that must be implemented:
  - handleMessageFromClient()

### ConnectionToClient interface

- Controlling methods:
  - sendToClient()
  - close()
- Accessing methods:
  - getInetAddress()
  - setInfo
  - getInfo()

### Using AbstractServer and ConnectionToClient

• Create a subclass of AbstractServer
• Implement the slot method
handleMessageFromClient
• Write code that:
— Creates an instance of the subclass of
AbstractServer
— Calls the listen method
— Sends messages to clients, using:

- the getClientConnections and sendToClient service methods
- or sendToAllClients
  • Implement one or more of the other callback methods

- SetInfo and getInfo make use of Hashmaps
- Hashmap: a data structure that stores key-value pairs
- Many methods in the server are synchronized i.e
- Server must pause from listening every 500ms to check if stopListenning() method has been called. if not it resumes listening immediately

## UML class diagram

- The Unified Modelling Language is a standard graphical language for modelling object oriented software

- class diagrams describe classes and their relationship
- Iteraction diagrams:
  - sequence and communication diagrams
  - show the behaviour of a system in terms of how object interact with each other
    • State diagrams and activity diagrams
    — show how systems or classes behave internally
    • Component and deployment diagrams
    — show how the various components of systems are
    arranged logically and physically

### UML class diagram essentials components

- classes
- Associations: represetn linkake between instance of classes
- Attributes: simple data found in classes and their instances
- Operations: functions found in classes and their instances
- Generalization: group classes into hierarchies
- multiplicity: the number of relationships between instances of classes.

### Representation

- Class:
  - box with name of class
  - may also rempresent attributes and operations
  - may also include method signatures (name and parameters) and return types
- Association and multiplicity:
  - line between classes
  - may include multiplicity

### Multiplicity

- 1: exactly one
- 0..1: zero or one
- 0.._: zero or more | _
- 1..\*: one or more

- - -> 1 : many to more
- - -> \* : many to many
- 1 -> 1 : one to one
- 1 -> \* : one to many

- avoid one-to-one relationships. Aggregate the two classes into one

- A frame can be added around the UML diagram .It is an optional feature that was added in UML 2.0. It is used to represent what the UML diagram is about.

### Association classes

- Sometimes, an attribute that concerns two associated classes cannot be placed in either of the classes

```
student *  -------- * courseSection
               |
          Registration
             - grade

same as

student 1 ------ * Registration * ------ 1 courseSection
```

### Reflexive association

- Association class connecting to a class itself:
  - prerequisite where one class is keeping track of sibling classes e.g: course keeping track of its prerequisites
  - The class also is found a set of sibling class: course is a prerequisite of another course

## Directionality in associations

- associations are by default bidirectional
- To limit the direction of an association , you can add an arrow to the association line

```
Day 1 ------ > * Lecture
```

### generalization

- a generalization set is a labeled group of generalization with a common superclass
- a label (discriminator) describes the criteria used in the specialization
- Arrow points to the superclass. Meaning `is a`
