## TUT1

- git: popular medium-high complexity version control tool
- Version control: Management tools used to manage changes to files e.g git, SVN, mercurial

## why

- Isolates developers from one another while they work
- Allows for selective and predictable integration of different portions of a
  project

## Core concepts

- A repository contains:
  - files
  - history
  - special configuration

- Git has 2 local states
  - working directory: folder/directory on your computer that holds all the project's files
  - staging area: queue that holds changes for the next commit
  - Local repository: git repository on your local machine (.git folder)
- Remote repository:
- branch
- Main branch
- why use branches?
  -Allow simultaneous work on multiple features or fixes

  - Isolate changes without affecting the main project

- `origin/main`- origin is shorthand name for the remote repository

## Basic command

```sh
git add $filename # add file to staging area. if . , will include all untracked files to staging area
git revert $filename # revert a file in the staging area
git status #print the status of the staging area
git push # send changes to remote server
git branch $NAME #createa new branch
```
