## TUT1

- git: popular medium-high complexity version control tool
- Version control: Management tools used to manage changes to files e.g git, SVN, mercurial

## why

- Isolates developers from one another while they work
- Allows for selective and predictable integration of different portions of a
  project

## Core concepts

- A repository contains:

  - files
  - history
  - special configuration

- Git has 2 local states
  - working directory: folder/directory on your computer that holds all the project's files
  - staging area: queue that holds changes for the next commit
  - Local repository: git repository on your local machine (.git folder)
- Remote repository:
- branch
- Main branch
- why use branches?
  -Allow simultaneous work on multiple features or fixes

  - Isolate changes without affecting the main project

- `origin/main`- origin is shorthand name for the remote repository

## Basic command

```sh
git add $filename # add file to staging area. if . , will include all untracked files to staging area
git revert $filename # revert a file in the staging area
git status #print the status of the staging area
git push # send changes to remote server
git branch $NAME #createa new branch
```

- Interface: an interface is a contract that stipulates what a class must have
- Abstract class: is a class that has at least one abstract method. An abstract class can not be instantiated
- Overriding: is when a subclass redefines a method from its superclass
- Overloading: is when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters
- dynamic binding: occurs when the decision about which method to run can only be made at runtime
- needed when:
  - a variable is declared to have a superclass as it type
  - there is more than one possible polymorphic method that could be run among the type of the variable and its subclass

### Wrapper class vs primitive type

Character c1 vs char c2

- Character c1 is a reference to an object of type Character and can contain functions that can be called on it. Character can also be used to instantiate a generic typed class.
- char c2 is a primitive type

### casting

- casting: is when you convert a variable from one type to another
- Types:
  - widening casting (automatic): converting a variable to a type that can hold a larger range of values. Automatic because you are not going to lose any data in the conversion
  - narrowing casting (): converting a variable to a type that can hold a smaller range of values

### Access modifiers

- public: accessible to all classes
- private: accessible only to the class itself
- protected: accessible to the class itself, its subclasses and classes in the same package
- default: accessible to the class itself and classes in the same package

### Exceptions

- Exception: a class with many subclasses for a specific type of error

- Package: combines related classes into subsystems
