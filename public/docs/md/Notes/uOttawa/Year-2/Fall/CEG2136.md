### logic Function

- Representation

  - Truth table
  - Logic/Boolean expression eg: z = x'
  - Logic diagram i.e diagram of the connected gates
  - K-maps

- Logic function is a binary relation that takes a set of inputs and returns a boolean (either True or false)
- N outputs = 2^(N inputs)
- `Propagation delay`: the time it takes for a circuit to respond to an input change
- `Rise-time`: The time it takes a circuit/gate to change from 10% to 90% of its amplitude
- `Fall-time`: The time it takes a circuit/gate to change from 90% to 10% of its amplitude
- you can't infinitely increase the frequency of a circuit since the propagation delay will stay the same and will rather get close to clock period leading to discrepancies in reading.
- How to get rid/reduce the propagation delay? use a better circuit/technology

## Boolean Algebra

### Boolean algebra axioms

- Commutative laws
  - x + y = y + x
  - x.y = y.x
- Associative laws
  - x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z
  - x.(y.z) = (x.y).z
- Distributive laws
  - x.(y + z) = x.y + x.z
  - x + (y.z) = (x + y).(x + z)
- Identity laws
  - x + 0 = x
  - x.1 = x
- Negation laws
  - x + x' = 1
  - x.x' = 0
- Idempotent laws
  - x + x = x
  - x.x = x
- Null laws
  - x + 1 = 1
  - x.0 = 0
- Absorption laws
  - x + (x.y) = x
  - x.(x + y) = x
- De Morgan's laws
  - (x + y)' = x'.y'
  - (x.y)' = x' + y'

### Truth table

- Try ordering your truth table in ascending order of the inputs
- There are 16 possible functions for 2 input variables
- Functions include: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, NOT, X, Y, 0, 1

### Logic expression

### Normal forms

- Disjunctive Normal Form/ SoP(Sum of products)
- COnjunctive Normal Form/ PoS(Product of sums)

### Canonical forms

- SoP == minterms expression

  - where output is 1
  - 0 is represented by complement `x'` and 1 is represented by the variable `x`
  - F(x,y) = ∑m(0,1,2,3)
  - F(x,y) = x'y' + x'y + xy' + xy

- PoS == maxterms expression
  - where output is 0
  - F(x,y) = ∏M(0,1,2,3)
  - F(x,y) = (x+y).(x+y').(x'+y).(x'+y')

## Cost

1. The cost of a circuit is proportional to the number of gate inputs
2. One gate input costs 1 Cost Unit (CU) then the cost of the circuit is the sum of the number of inputs of all gates

- Not gates not counted and assumed to be given for free

### Incompletely specified functions/ Dont care conditions

- Undefined situations
- cant happen conditions

### Combinational circuits

- A combinational circuit: is a setup of connected logic gates implementing a logic function. The output of a combinational circuit depends only on the current input values.

### Sequential circuits

- A sequential circuit: is a setup of connected logic gates implementing a logic function. The output of a sequential circuit depends on the current input values, the clock and/or the previous state of the circuit.
- Types:

  - Synchronous: the output changes only at discrete time instants
  - Asynchronous: the output changes as soon as the input changes

- state diagram: directed graph connection of all the possible states of the sequential circuit showing the transitions between states

### Classical automata

```
input x   ->| internal |
            |          |  -> output z
clock     ->|   state  |
```

### Moore automata

- output depends only on the state
- z = f(x), s+ = f(x,s)

### Mealy automata

- output depends on the state and the input
- z = f(x,s), s+ = f(x,s)

### SR latch

| S   | R   | Q(t)+ dt  | instruction |
| --- | --- | --------- | ----------- |
| 0   | 0   | Q(t)      | hold        |
| 0   | 1   | 0         | reset       |
| 1   | 0   | 1         | set         |
| 1   | 1   | Undefined | Undefined   |

### JK flip flop

| J   | K   | Q(t)+ dt | instruction |
| --- | --- | -------- | ----------- |
| 0   | 0   | Q(t)     | hold        |
| 0   | 1   | 0        | reset       |
| 1   | 0   | 1        | set         |
| 1   | 1   | Q'(t)    | toggle      |

- toggle: flip whichever value is stored in memory
- takes care of undefined behavior of SR latch
- `|>` - positive edge triggered (rising edge)
- `O|>` - negative edge triggered (falling edge)

### D flip flop

| D   | Q(t)+ dt | instruction |
| --- | -------- | ----------- |
| 0   | 0        | reset       |
| 1   | 1        | set         |

- usually has an enable input

### T flip flop

| T   | Q(t) | Q(t)+ dt | instruction |
| --- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| 0   | 0    | 0        | hold        |
| 0   | 1    | 1        | hold        |
| 1   | 0    | 1        | toggle      |
| 1   | 1    | 0        | toggle      |

- T : toggles which ever value is stored in memory

## Sequential circuits - FSM

- FSM (Finite state machine)
- What is an excitation table?

  - A table that shows the next state of the circuit given the current state and the input
  - just flip to have the output as input and inputs as output

- Transition function (delta) δ
- Output function (lambda) λ

- Table
  - input
  - present states of flip flops(memory)
  - next states of flip flops
  - output

| x   | s(t) | s(t+1) | z   |
| --- | ---- | ------ | --- |

| Present | states | Input | Next | state | Output |
| ------- | ------ | ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| A       | B      | x     | A+   | B+    | Y      |
|         |        |       |      |       |        |

### Deriving state diagram from excitation table

- Present states will be the states of the state diagram
- arcs = transitions between each state
  - `input / output`

```
00  -> 0/1 -> 01
|             ^
v 1/0         | 0/1
10  -> 1/0 -> 00
```

### Sequential circuit design flow

1. From the FSM make a state diagram
2. From the state diagram make a state table (without flip flop)
3. State assignment: assign each state to a binary value. For N states you need log2(N) digits
4. Make excitation table (with flip flop values)
5. FInd simplified equations for the flip flops inputs ad circuit outputs
6. Build the circuit

### efficient JK value derivation

| Q   | Q+  | J   | K   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | X   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | X   |
| 1   | 0   | X   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | X   | 0   |

### Decoders (3-8 decoder)

- a decoder is a combinational circuit that converts binary information from an n-bit input to a maximum of 2^n output bit.
- usually used to give complemented outputs i.e A'B', AB', AB
- gives permutations of the inputs

### encorder (4-2 encorder)

- a combinational circuit that performs the opposite operation of a decoder
- it has 2^n inputs and n outputs

### Multiplexer (4-1 mux)

- A multiplexer is a combinational circuit that receives binary information from multiple input lines (2^n) and directs it to a single output line.
- E.g: Network printer switch

### Map-entered variables (MEV)

- Maps with entered variables are Karnaugh Maps which can have Boolean expression in its cells, not just ones and zeros. These maps are also referred to as Variable-Entered Maps. However, in most literature the MEV acronym is used.

- These maps are useful to represent functions with large number of variables in a map of lower order. They are also used to describe flip-flop’s excitation functions.

#### Implementation using mulitplexers

1. 2^n to 1 mux directly
2. 2^(n-1) to 1 mux by applying MEV
3. 2^(n-k) to 1 mux + gates by using functional decomposition

### Implementation suing gates (SOP)

### Making K-maps for MEV

- choose whether the MEV is 0 or 1
- Make the simplified equation with it e.g F = EPI + PI(MEV)

## Registers

- A register is a n-group of flip-flop used to store a n-bit of information

### shift register

- `shift register` is a register that is capable of shifting its binary
  information in one or both directions.
- `Serial input`: the external input being fed into the shift register
- `Serial output`: denotes the data that is not fed into any of the
  register’s flip-flops.
- two type:

  - right shift register
  - left shift register

- Mostly implemented using D flip flops

## Multi function registers

- Most general registers have the following capabilities:

1. A clock pulse input to synchronize all operations.
2. A shift right operation and a serial input line associated to it.
3. A shift left operation and a serial input line associated to it.
4. A parallel load operation and n input lines associated to it.
5. n parallel output lines
6. A “no change” control state to leave the n parallel output lines
   unchanged for the next clock pulse.

| S1S0 | Register operation |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| 00   | no change          |
| 01   | shift right        |
| 10   | shift left         |
| 11   | parallel load      |

- `S`: select line
- implemented using multiplexers

## counters

- Register that goes through a prescribed series of states
- There are two types:
  - Asynchronous counters (Ripple counter)
  - synchronous counters

### Asynchronous counters

- flip flops output serve as clock for triggering connected flip flops
- the output of the first flip flop is the clock for the second flip flop and so on
- Only the first flip flop is triggered by the external clock
- Triggered on the falling edge of the clock `o|>`

### Synchronous counters

- all flip flop are triggered by a clock signal at the same time
- the clock signal is connected to all flip flops

## cascaded counters

- built from multiple counter blocks connected in series

# Chapter 3 - Data Representation

- MSB - Most significant bit. The bit at the left of the binary number
- LSB - Least significant bit. The bit at the right of the binary number

## 1's complement

- The 1's complement of a binary number is the number obtained by replacing all 0's with 1's and all 1's with 0's

## 2's complement

- The 2's complement of a binary number is the number obtained by adding 1 to the 1's complement of the number

## Binary conversion

- To convert a binary number to:
  - `Decimal`: multiply each bit by 2^(n-1) where n is the position of the bit from the left
  - `octal`: group the bits in groups of 3 starting from the right and convert each group to decimal
  - `hexadecimal`: group the bits in groups of 4 starting from the right and convert each group to decimal

## Signed numbers

- `Unsigned numbers` are numbers that are always assumed to be non-negative (i.e., ≥ 0).
- `Signed numbers` are numbers that can be either non-negative or negative.
- For a signed number, the sign bit is :
  - `0` for positive numbers
  - `1` for negative numbers

#### Signed complement

- The `MSb` is the sign bit
- you dont change the sign bit but you change the rest of the bits
- Ex:
  - -14 -> 10001110
  - 1's complement(-14) -> 11110001
  - 2's complement(-14) -> 11110010

### Binary arithmetic

- For positive numbers, just add the numbers
- For negative numbers, convert the negative number to its 2's complement and add the numbers
- A carry in 2's complement is not an overflow.
- The carry would be the sign bit of the result if you had a bigger number of bits

### Overflow

- Overflow: the result is out of the domain
- For unsigned numbers, an overflow occurs when the carry out of the MSB is 1
- For a 2's complement representation of signed numbers:
  - An overflow occurs when the carry into the MSB is not equal to the carry out of the MSB e.g. 0111 + 0001 = 1000
  - if the addends have the same sign but the sum has a different sign
- An overflow in a subtraction operation cannot possibly exist.

### SUbtraction using 2's complement

- -176-204

1. Determine the result of the subtraction in decimal and determine how many bits are need to avoid an overflow

- -176 - 204 = -380 (9 bits + sign bit = 10 bits)

2. convert both numbers to 2's complement

- 176 -> `0`0 1011 0000
- 176(1's) -> `1`1 0100 1111
- 176(2's) -> `1`1 0101 0001

- 204 -> `0`0 1100 1100
- 204(1's) -> `1`1 0011 0011
- 204(2's) -> `1`1 0011 0100

3. Add the numbers

- 101010001 + 100110100 = 110000101 = -380

## Floating point representation

- Floating numbers are represented in scientific notation
- `m x r^e`
- `m` is the mantissa
- `r` is the radix
- `e` is the exponent
- only the mantissa and exponent are stored in the computer
- the radix is fixed for a given hardware usually 2
- Normalized form: if the MSB(excluding the sign bit) is non zero

### IEEE 754 standard

#### Single precision (32 bits)

- sign bit (1 bit)
- exponent (8 bits)
- mantissa (23 bits)

#### Double precision (64 bits)

- sign bit (1 bit)
- exponent (11 bits)
- mantissa (52 bits)

- 36.5625 -> 100100.1001

# ASCII

- American Standard Code for Information Interchange
- 7 bits
- 128 characters

## Gray codes

- A Gray code is a binary code in which successive numbers differ in only one bit.

| Binary Gray | decimal |
| ----------- | ------- |
| 0000        | 0       |
| 0001        | 1       |
| 0011        | 2       |
| 0010        | 3       |

| 0101        | 6       |
| 0100        | 7       |
| 1100        | 8       |
| 1101        | 9       |
| 1111        | 10      |
| 1110        | 11      |
| 1010        | 12      |
| 1011        | 13      |
| 1001        | 14      |
| 1000        | 15      |

### Error detection codes

- `Parity bit`: a parity bit is an extra bit included with a binary message to make the number of 1's either even or odd
- Error detection code is a binary code that detects digital errors during transmission

## Chapter 4 - Register Transfer & Micro-operations & ALU

- `Micro-operation`: an operation executed on data stored in registers within one clock cycle
- Examples:
  - shift
  - count
  - clear
  - load
- `Register Transfer Language`: a symbolic notation used to describe micro-operations

- A register is designated by a capital letter and possibly a numeral
- `R1`: general purpose register
- `PC`: program counter
- `IR`: instruction register
- `MAR`: memory address register

- R2 ← R1: transfer the content of R1 to R2
- The contents of the origin register are not modified
- R2 ← R1, R1 ← R2 - denotes that these operations are to be carried out at the same time and will result into a swap operation

### Basic symbols

| Symbol                 | description                                                             | Example          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Letters (and numerals) | denotes a register                                                      | MAR; R2          |
| Parentheses ()         | denotes a part of a register                                            | R1(0-7), R2(L)   |
| Left Arrow ←           | denotes a transfer of information                                       | R1 ← R2          |
| Comma ,                | denotes separation of two micro-operations (happening at the same time) | R1 ← R2, R2 ← R1 |

### Control function

- A control function is a boolean variable that specifies whether a micro-operation is to be performed or not

#### P: R2 ← R1

- The above means `if(P==1) then (R2 ← R1)`

## structure of a basic computer

1. The computer accepts external information in the form of sequence of instructions (`programs`) and `data` through an input unit and stores them in the memory
2. In the `CPU` (Central Processing Unit): the data stored in the memory is fetched, under the program control, and processed in the ALU of the Data Path.
3. The processed data leaves the computer through an output unit.
4. All activities inside the computer are directed by the Control Unit

<center>
<img src="https://www.computerscience.gcse.guru/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Von-Neumann-Architecture-Diagram.jpg">
</center>

- The `Control Unit` (CU) of the CPU is a “programmable” sequential circuit which changes its transition function depending on the instruction to be performed.

## Common bus

- a computer has a multitude of registers and having wires to connect them would require a lot of wires
- A more efficient scheme is to transfer data between registers using a common bus system
- Each register is connected to the bus using a wire and a control signal determines which register is connected to the bus at a given time
- It is implemented using a multiplexer
- using RTL(Register Transfer Language):

  1. Select the source register by setting the select lines of the multiplexer
  2. The destination is selected by applying `LD`(Load) to the control input of the destination register

- There have to be a multiplexer per bit. For each bit register there should be a multiplexer linked to it to determine if it is transferring data or data is being loaded into it.
- R2 ← R1
  - Bus ← R1
  - R2 ← Bus

### Addition micro-operation

- R3 ← R1 + R2
- Add contents of R1 and R2 and store the result in R3

| Symbolic designation (RTL) | Description                                         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| R3 ← R1 + R2               | content of R1 plus content of R2 transferred to R3  |
| R3 ← R1- R2                | content of R1 minus content of R2 transferred to R3 |
| R2 ← R2'                   | 1's complement of R2                                |
| R2 ← R2' + 1               | 2's complement of R2(negate)                        |
| R3 ← R1 + R2' +1           | R1 plus the 2's complement of R2 (subtraction)      |
| R1 ← R1 + 1                | increment R1 by 1                                   |
| R1 ← R1 - 1                | decrement R1 by 1                                   |

- For an add micro-op, we need a least 2 registers to hold the two numbers and possibly one to hold the result

#### Half-adder vs Full-adder

Half-adder takes in 2 inputs and gives out a sum and a carry while full-adder takes in 2 inputs and a carry input and gives out a sum and a carry output

### Adding multi-bits

- `Adder`: a combinational circuit that is made of full adders connected in cascade
- `cascade`: output of the first is input for the second and so on

- cascading has the problem that the latency/delay of each full adder adds up.
- If the total time taken to propagate is lower than the clock, all is good. If not there will be a problem that the result will miss its clock count to get loaded into a register.
- So the total delay for an adder circuit no matter the size of the input should always be less than the clock period

#### Solutions

1. Look-ahead carry generator

- the carry is generated before the addition is done
- trade of between speed and cost/size

2. Using mode select line (standard adder)
<center>
<img src="https://www.expertsmind.com/CMSImages/2153_Explain%20about%204-bit%20adder-subtractor%20circuit.png">
</center>

- For unsigned numbers:

  - m = 0 -> add. Overflow occurs if Cn=1(last carry)
  - m = 1 -> subtract. No overflow possible A >= B
  - m = 1 -> subtract. If A < B, then the sum bits gives the result of the 2's complement of (B-A). No overflow possible

3. 8 bit adder/subtractor with overflow detection

### Binary incremeter

- One way of implementing a binary incrementer is using a binary counter.
  • Another way of implementing a binary incrementer is using half-adders (HA) connected
  in cascade

## Arithmetic Circuit

- Arithmetic circuit is a combinational circuit that performs common arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) on binary numbers.
- Made up of:
  1. Multiplixer
  2. Micro-op circuits(adders, subtractors, incrementers, transfer, etc) connected to the mux

### Logic micro-operations

- Logic microoperations perform ordinary boolean operations on data
  stored in two registers. Example: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.

### Logic unit

- A logic unit is a combinational circuit that performs logic microoperations on binary

Table : Example of 2 bit logic unit

| s1  | s1  | output  | operation |
| --- | --- | ------- | --------- |
| 0   | 0   | A^B     | AND       |
| 0   | 1   | A + B   | OR        |
| 1   | 0   | A XOR B | XOR       |
| 1   | 1   | A'      | NOT       |

### Applications

- Manipulate individual bits or portions of a word stored in a register
- Examples of bit manipulation ops include:
  - selective-set: sets certain bits of A to 1 and keeps the remaining bits unchanged
  - selective-complement(AXORB): complements bits in A where there are corresponding 1’s in B . It keeps the remaining bits of A unchanged
  - selective-clear (A^B'): resets to 0 bits in A where there are corresponding 1’s in B . It keeps the remaining bits of A unchanged.
  - mask (A ← A ^ B): resets to 0 bits in A where there are corresponding 0’s in B . It keeps the remaining bits of A unchanged.
  - insert: n inserts a new value into a group of bits. This is done by first masking that group of bits and OR-ing it with the required value.
  ```
  A ← A ^ B(mask corresponding to the number of bits to be inserted 3 bits = 111, 4 bits = 1111)
  B ← appropriate operand
  A ← A OR B
  ```
  - clear ((A ← A XOR B)): compares the words in A and B and produces an all 0’s result if the two numbers are equal.

### Shift micro-operations

- There are 3 types of shift micro-ops:
  1. logical shift
  2. circular shift
  3. arithmetic shift

#### 1. Logical shift

- A logical shift is one that inserts a ’0’ into the register through the serial
  input. The same pin (SerIn) can be used for both left/right operations.
- `shl` and `shr` will be used to symbolize shift-left and shift-right
  micro-operations.

#### 2. Circular shift

- The circular shift (also known as rotate micro-operation) circulates the
  bit of the register around the two ends without loss of information,
- This is accomplished by connecting the serial output of the shift register
  to its serial input.

### Arithmetic shift

- An arithmetic shift is a micro-operation that shifts a signed number left or right.
- An arithmetic shift-left performs a signed multiplication by 2.
- An arithmetic shift-right performs a signed division by 2.
- An arithmetic shift has to be done in a particular way so as not to change the value of the sign bit

### Arithmetic Shift-Right

- The arithmetic shift-right `leaves the sign bit unchanged` and `shifts the number` (including the sign bit) to the right. Equivalent with `division by 2`.

### Arithmetic Shift-Left

- The arithmetic shift-left inserts a ’0’ into the register’s least significant position and shifts all the other bits to the left (including the sign bit), exactly like logical shift-left. It is equivalent with `multiplication by 2`
- overflow may occur since the sign bit may go out of range

## Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit (ALSU)

- An `arithmetic logic unit (ALU) `is a combinational circuit that performs arithmetic and logic microoperations
- An `arithmetic logic shift unit` (ALSU) is an ALU that also performs shift microoperations

- One way of implementing an n-bit ALSU is to build a one-stage ALSU (for one bit only) and then stack n replicates of it together (one for each bit) to form the full ALSU. (use Mux)
- All replicates of the one-stage ALSU will use the same selection bits.
