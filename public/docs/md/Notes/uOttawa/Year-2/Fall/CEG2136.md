## Lec 2

### logic Function

- Representation

  - Truth table
  - Logic/Boolean expression eg: z = x'
  - Logic diagram i.e diagram of the connected gates
  - K-maps

- Logic function is a binary relation that takes a set of inputs and returns a boolean (either True or false)
- N outputs = 2^(N inputs)
- `Propagation delay`: the time it takes for a circuit to respond to an input change
- `Rise-time`: The time it takes a circuit/gate to change from 10% to 90% of its amplitude
- `Fall-time`: The time it takes a circuit/gate to change from 90% to 10% of its amplitude
- you can't infinitely increase the frequency of a circuit since the propagation delay will stay the same and will rather get close to clock period leading to discrepancies in reading.
- How to get rid/reduce the propagation delay? use a better circuit/technology

## Boolean Algebra

### Boolean algebra axioms

- Commutative laws
  - x + y = y + x
  - x.y = y.x
- Associative laws
  - x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z
  - x.(y.z) = (x.y).z
- Distributive laws
  - x.(y + z) = x.y + x.z
  - x + (y.z) = (x + y).(x + z)
- Identity laws
  - x + 0 = x
  - x.1 = x
- Negation laws
  - x + x' = 1
  - x.x' = 0
- Idempotent laws
  - x + x = x
  - x.x = x
- Null laws
  - x + 1 = 1
  - x.0 = 0
- Absorption laws
  - x + (x.y) = x
  - x.(x + y) = x
- De Morgan's laws
  - (x + y)' = x'.y'
  - (x.y)' = x' + y'

### Truth table

- Try ordering your truth table in ascending order of the inputs
- There are 16 possible functions for 2 input variables
- Functions include: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, NOT, X, Y, 0, 1

### Logic expression

### Normal forms

- Disjunctive Normal Form/ SoP(Sum of products)
- COnjunctive Normal Form/ PoS(Product of sums)

### Canonical forms

- SoP == minterms expression

  - where output is 1
  - 0 is represented by complement `x'` and 1 is represented by the variable `x`
  - F(x,y) = ∑m(0,1,2,3)
  - F(x,y) = x'y' + x'y + xy' + xy

- PoS == maxterms expression
  - where output is 0
  - F(x,y) = ∏M(0,1,2,3)
  - F(x,y) = (x+y).(x+y').(x'+y).(x'+y')

## Cost

1. The cost of a circuit is proportional to the number of gate inputs
2. One gate input costs 1 Cost Unit (CU) then the cost of the circuit is the sum of the number of inputs of all gates

- Not gates not counted and assumed to be given for free

### Logic minimization

- `Def`: logic minimization aims to reduce the n of gates and inputs per gate
- `cost function`: the number of gates' inputs
- Minimization will reduce

  - cost
  - power consumption
  - propagation delay

- Manual proc:
  - Boolean algebra rules
  - K-map
- Automatic procedure:
  - Finding all the prime implicants
  - finding the minimum cover form the PI's list

### Boolean uniting theorem

- take 2 elements subsets in the ON-set and remove the variable that is different in the pair

### Minimum cover = ∀ EPI + 1 PI
