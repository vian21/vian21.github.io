          <p>
            My name is Patrick Igiraneza and I am a passionate Software
            developer. I am currently enrolled at the university of
            Ottawa in Software engineering. I love tweaking software, making music and figuring stuff out.
          </p>

          <p>
            I play the electric guitar, acoustic, bass, and piano.
            I have mostly worked on the web, exploring all its greatness and
            beauty, and lately I have started gaining an interest in embedded
            software, operating systems and cybersecurity.
          </p>

          <p>Take a look of some cool stuff I have worked on!</p>
