          <p>
            My name is Patrick Igiraneza, I am an enthusiastic Software/Web
            developer. I am originally from Burundi which is a country found in
            the east of Africa. I am currently enrolled at the university of
            Ottawa in Software engineering(CO-OP) in French Immersion.
          </p>

            I love tweaking software, making music and figuring stuff out. I
            mainly play the electric guitar(for now) but I am also working on
            improving my piano üéπ skills as well as my musical ear. I play the
            acoustic, bass, piano and unfortunately no drums(yet üòÅ).
          </p>

          <p>
            I have mostly worked on the web, exploring all its greatness and
            beauty, and lately I have started gaining interest in embedded
            software, operating systems and cybersecurity ü§ñ.
          </p>

          <p>Take a look of some cool stuff I have worked on!</p>
