# SEG2105

## TUT1

- git: popular medium-high complexity version control tool
- Version control: Management tools used to manage changes to files e.g git, SVN, mercurial

## why

- Isolates developers from one another while they work
- Allows for selective and predictable integration of different portions of a
  project

## Core concepts

- A repository contains:

  - files
  - history
  - special configuration

- Git has 2 local states
  - working directory: folder/directory on your computer that holds all the project's files
  - staging area: queue that holds changes for the next commit
  - Local repository: git repository on your local machine (.git folder)
- Remote repository:
- branch
- Main branch
- why use branches?
  -Allow simultaneous work on multiple features or fixes

  - Isolate changes without affecting the main project

- `origin/main`- origin is shorthand name for the remote repository

## Basic command

```bash
git add $filename # add file to staging area. if . , will include all untracked files to staging area
git revert $filename # revert a file in the staging area
git status #print the status of the staging area
git push # send changes to remote server
git branch $NAME #createa new branch
```

- Interface: an interface is a contract that stipulates what a class must have
- Abstract class: is a class that has at least one abstract method. An abstract class can not be instantiated
- Overriding: is when a subclass redefines a method from its superclass
- Overloading: is when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters
- dynamic binding: occurs when the decision about which method to run can only be made at runtime
- needed when:
  - a variable is declared to have a superclass as it type
  - there is more than one possible polymorphic method that could be run among the type of the variable and its subclass

### Wrapper class vs primitive type

Character c1 vs char c2

- Character c1 is a reference to an object of type Character and can contain functions that can be called on it. Character can also be used to instantiate a generic typed class.
- char c2 is a primitive type

### casting

- casting: is when you convert a variable from one type to another
- Types:
  - widening casting (automatic): converting a variable to a type that can hold a larger range of values. Automatic because you are not going to lose any data in the conversion
  - narrowing casting (): converting a variable to a type that can hold a smaller range of values

### Access modifiers

- public: accessible to all classes
- private: accessible only to the class itself
- protected: accessible to the class itself, its subclasses and classes in the same package
- default: accessible to the class itself and classes in the same package

### Exceptions

- Exception: a class with many subclasses for a specific type of error

- Package: combines related classes into subsystems

## Programming style guide

- always choose the simple alternative
- reject clever code that is hard to understand
- shorter code is not necessarily better
- Choose good names
  - make them highly descriptive
  - do not worry about long names

## Reusability

- Def: the ability to use existing code to create new software
- SOftware eng should avoid rewriting code that already exists

### Types of reuse

- Reuse of expertise
- reuse of standard designs and algorithms
- reuse of libraries of classes or procedures
- reuse of powerful commands built into a programming language and OS
- Reuse of frameworks
- reuse of complete applications

### Reusable components

- component: a self-contained, reusable software unit that can be combined with other components to create a larger software system
- Framework: a reusable software that implements a generic solution to a generalized problem
- Library:
- It provides common facilities applicable to different application programs
- principle: applications that do different but related things tend to have similar designs

- callbacks: functions that the frameworks calls withing the application code. It expects the application to provide the code for the callback functions
- The collection of services provided by the frameworks is called the framework API (Application Programming Interface)
- 2 types:
  - slots: callbacks that are mandatory by the framework. They are required by the framework but they are not implemented
  - hooks: optional callbacks.

### Object-oriented frameworks

- a frameworks is composed of a library of classes
- The API is the set of all public methods of theses classes

## Types of frameworks

- Horizontal frameworks: provides a large set of services that can be used by many different types of applications
- A vertical frameworks(application frameworks): is more complete but still requires slots to be implemented by the developer. It is more specialized for certain uses

### Client-server architecture

- A distributed system is a system in which:

  - computations are performed by separate programs
  - normally running on separate hardware
  - that cooperate to perform a task

- server: a program that provides a service to other programs
- client: a program that uses a service provided by a server
- How many threads are present in a scenerio of 1 server and 2 clients? 7 threads
  - Server (3)
    - 1 thread for listening for clients
    - 2 threads for handling the clients
  - Client (2):
    - 1 thread for user interface
    - 1 thread for sending messages

## Sequence of activities

1. Server starts its execution
2. Server waits for a client to connect
3. Client starts its execution
4. Client connects to the server which can accept or refuse the connection
5. The server waits to receive messages from the connected clients
6. when a message is received the server performs certain operation and then goes back to standby
7. The client and server repeat this process until the client decides to disconnect

### Activities of a server

1. Initializes itself
2. starts listening for clients
3. Handles the following types of events:

- client connection
- respond to messages
- handle client disconnection

4. May stop listening
5. Must cleanly terminate

## Activities of a client

1. Initializes itself
2. Initialize a connection to the server
3. sends mes c sages
4. handles the following types of events from the server:

- respond to message
- handle server disconnection

4. must cleanly terminate

- activity diagram: a diagram that shows the sequence of activities in a system
- State diagram: a state diagram is a diagram that shows the different states that an object can be in and the transitions between those states

# TUT 2 - Android 1

- Android is an open source mobile operating system based on Linux
- Android studio is the official IDE for android development and support Java and Kotlin

### AVD

- AVD - Android Virtual Device
  - An android device emulator configuration that specifies the characteristics of an android phone, tablet, Android TV or Wear OS device that you want to simulate in the Android Emulator
- Consists of:
  - Hardware profile: defines the characteristics of the virtual device i.e camera, screen size, resolution, CPU, RAM, storage, etc
  - system image: the android OS that runs on the virtual device
  - Dedicated storage on host computer
  - others e.g appearance, skins, network, etc

## Thin client vs fat client

- Thin client (cloud gaming):
  - client is made as small as possible
  - most of the processing is done on the server
  - client is easy to download over the network
- Fat client:
  - As much work as possible is handled on the client
  - server can handle more clients

## Communication protocol

- Protocol: a set of rules that governs the communication between two entities

### Task to perform to develop client-server application

1. design the primary work to be done on the client and server
2. design How will the work be distributed
3.
4. TODO

## OCSF - Object Client Server Framework

- "Soft eng using the OCSF never modify its three classes"

1. AbstractClient
2. AbstractServer
3. ConnectionToClient

- SOft eng :
  • Create subclasses of the abstract classes in the
  framework
  • Call public methods that are provided by the framework
  • Override certain slot and hook methods (explicitly
  designed to be overridden)

## CLient

- consists of a sing class : abstractClient
- must be subclasses:
  - any subclass must implement : `handleMessageFromServer`
  - implement the Runnable interface

## AbstractClient interface

- Controlling methods:
  - openConnection()
  - closeConnection()
  - sendToServer()
- Accessing methods:

  - isConnected()
  - getHost()
  - setHost()
  - getPort()
  - getInetAddress()

  ## Server

  - consists of two classes: AbstractServer and ConnectionToClient
  - AbstractServer: thread that listens for new connections
  - ConnectionToClient: one for the threads that handle a clients

### AbstractServer interface

- Controlling methods:
  - listen()
  - stopListening()
  - sendToAllClients()
  - close()
- Accessing methods:

  - isListening()
  - getClientConnections()
  - getPort
  - setPort()
  - setBacklog()

- methods may be overridden:
- serverStarted()
- serverStopped()
- clientConnected()
- clientDisconnected()
- clientException()
- listeningException()
- serverClosed()
- Methods that must be implemented:
  - handleMessageFromClient()

### ConnectionToClient interface

- Controlling methods:
  - sendToClient()
  - close()
- Accessing methods:
  - getInetAddress()
  - setInfo
  - getInfo()

### Using AbstractServer and ConnectionToClient

• Create a subclass of AbstractServer
• Implement the slot method
handleMessageFromClient
• Write code that:
— Creates an instance of the subclass of
AbstractServer
— Calls the listen method
— Sends messages to clients, using:

- the getClientConnections and sendToClient service methods
- or sendToAllClients
  • Implement one or more of the other callback methods

- SetInfo and getInfo make use of Hashmaps
- Hashmap: a data structure that stores key-value pairs
- Many methods in the server are synchronized i.e
- Server must pause from listening every 500ms to check if stopListenning() method has been called. if not it resumes listening immediately

## UML class diagram

Source: http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~cs3443/uml/uml.html

- The Unified Modelling Language is a standard graphical language for modelling object oriented software

- class diagrams describe classes and their relationship
- Iteraction diagrams:
  - sequence and communication diagrams
  - show the behaviour of a system in terms of how object interact with each other
    • State diagrams and activity diagrams
    — show how systems or classes behave internally
    • Component and deployment diagrams
    — show how the various components of systems are
    arranged logically and physically

### UML class diagram essentials components

- classes
- Associations: represetn linkake between instance of classes
- Attributes: simple data found in classes and their instances
- Operations: functions found in classes and their instances
- Generalization: group classes into hierarchies
- multiplicity: the number of relationships between instances of classes.

### Representation

- Class:
  - box with name of class
  - may also rempresent attributes and operations
  - may also include method signatures (name and parameters) and return types
- Association and multiplicity:
  - line between classes
  - may include multiplicity

### Multiplicity

- 1: exactly one
- 0..1: zero or one
- 0.._: zero or more | _
- 1..\*: one or more

- - -> 1 : many to more
- - -> \* : many to many
- 1 -> 1 : one to one
- 1 -> \* : one to many

- avoid one-to-one relationships. Aggregate the two classes into one

- A frame can be added around the UML diagram .It is an optional feature that was added in UML 2.0. It is used to represent what the UML diagram is about.

### Association classes

- Sometimes, an attribute that concerns two associated classes cannot be placed in either of the classes

```
student *  -------- * courseSection
               |
          Registration
             - grade

same as

student 1 ------ * Registration * ------ 1 courseSection
```

### Reflexive association

- Association class connecting to a class itself:
  - prerequisite where one class is keeping track of sibling classes e.g: course keeping track of its prerequisites
  - The class also is found a set of sibling class: course is a prerequisite of another course

## Directionality in associations

- associations are by default bidirectional
- To limit the direction of an association , you can add an arrow to the association line

```
Day 1 ------ > * Lecture
```

### Generalization

- a generalization set is a labeled group of generalization with a common superclass
- a label (discriminator) describes the criteria used in the specialization
- Arrow points to the superclass. Meaning `is a`

### Object diagram

- These have object names underlined unlike class diagrams
- `Link`: is an instance of an association
- No inheritance in object diagrams
- Associations represent the relationship that will exist between the objects at runtime

- DONT MAKE HIERACHIES WHERE AN OBJECT MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE CLASS

### More Advance Features: Aggregation

- `Aggregation` are special associations that represent` part-whole` relationships e.g vehicle part is a part of a vehicle
- Aggregation symbol: `<>`
- There is no implementation in code but is beneficial to the programmer to know that there is a relationship between those two classes. That one object is made up from some sum of the other object

### Composition

- Composition is a special type of aggregation where if the whole part is destroyed, the part is also destroyed

### Interfaces

- Look like classes but you add the keyword `interface`
- same lines like inheritance but with a dotted line

## Developing UML class diagrams

- DOmain analysis: determine how things are done by the client/ in the real world

### Types

- Exploratory Domain model: developed in domain analysis to learn about the domain
- System domain model: models aspects of the domain represented by the system
- System model: includes classes used to build the user interface and system architecture. Things you make to build the system

# Lec

Friday 6th Oct 2023

- If you can get away with something by making a string, it is probably an attribute
- If it is more complicated like an address (street, city, province, etc) it is probably a class (data structure).

### Actions vs association

- Common mistake: representing actions as associations
- for example a library client returns or borrows 1 | more books. This is an action not an association.

### Identifying attributes

- Look for information that must be maintained about each class
- an attribute should have a simple value/type e.g string, int, etc
- it is not good to have duplicate attributes e.g address. One person can have multiple address. Rather have another class and make the association between the two classes

### identifying interfaces

- create an interface instead of a class if:
  - the classes are very dissimilar except for having a few operations in common
  - one or more of the class already have their own superclass.

</center>

### Allocating responsibilities to classes

- All responsibilities of a given class should be clearly related
- if a class has too many responsibilities, then consider splitting it into distinct classes
- if a class has no responsibilities, it is probably useless
- When a responsibility can not be attributed to any existing class then a new class should be created

- To determine responsibilities:
  - make a use case analysis
  - look for verbs and nouns describing actions in the system

# Lec

- A single → means that it is a uni directional association

- For a many to one, each class has to have a variable for the 1 class
- For the one to many, the class has to have list of all the classes that are associated with it

## Object Constraint Language (OCL)

- OCL is a specification language designed to formally specify the constraints in software modules
- It defines which logical fact about a system must be true
- Constraints can not have side effects - cannot compute a non-boolean result nor modify data
- OCL statements in class diagrams can specify what the values of attributes and associations must be

- `Invariants`: constrains that must be true for an object during its lifetime
- to describe pre and post conditions on operations and methods

```yml
context Person
  inv: self.age >=18;
  inv: self::getAge() >=18; #method
```

```yml
context Person
  inv: self.fleet->size() <=3;
```

- use `->` to get access to a method of a class

```yml
context Person
  inv: self.fleet->select(v | v.colour = Colour.black)->size() <=3;
```

- `|` - where

### make sure that age is x after calling setaAge()?

```yml
context Person::setAge(newAge:int)
  pre: self.age>0 & newAge>0
  post: self.age = newAge
```

## Developing requirements

### Domain analysis

- The process by which software engineer learns about the domain to better understand the problem
- Domain expert is a person who has a deep knowledge of the domain

### Benefits of domain analysis

1. Faster development
2. Better system
3. Anticipation of extensions

### Domain analysis document

1. Quick summary
1. Glossary
1. general knowledge about the domain
1. Customers and users
1. The environment
1. Tasks and procedures currently performed
1. Competing software
1. Similarities to other domains

# Using Patterns - Lec

Wed 1 Nov 2023

- A pattern is the outline of a reusable solution to a general problem encountered in a particular context

- a good patterns should be:
  - be as general as possible
  - contain a solution that has proven to be effectively

### Pattern description

- `Context`: The general situation in which the pattern applies
- `Problem`: A short sentence or two raising the main difficulty.
- `Forces`: The issues or concerns to consider when solving the problem
- Solution: The recommended way to solve the problem in the given context.
- `Antipatterns`: (Optional) Solutions that are inferior or do not work in this context.
- `Related patterns`: (Optional) Patterns that are similar to this pattern.
- `References`: Who developed or inspired the pattern

### Patterns

TODO

### Singleton pattern

### Adapter Pattern

- Context: you have a class that you want to integrate in your hierarchy but it does not have the same interface as the other classes in the hierarchy. You want to use the class in your hierachy without modifying it.
- Solution:
  - Create a class in your hierarchy that calls the methods in the class you want to integrate without changing their signature

### Facade pattern

- Context: you have a tightly coupled system and changing a method name or signature would break the system
- Solution:
  - Create a facade class that has the methods that system A would call in B and would delegate the work to the actual class methods in B. Methods in B are free to be changed/updated given that you update how they are called in the facade class
- Used in libraries, Databases

### Immutable pattern

- An immutable object is an object whose state never changes after it is created
- You dont want the object to be changed after it is created, it only has getters
- More thread safe since only threads can not change the state of the object but can just read it
- Solution:
  - attributes should be private and only accessed through getters
  - attibutes are set only in the constructor
  - setters will just return a new instance of the class

### Read only pattern

- Context: you want an object to be only modifiable by certain classes but not others
- Solution:
  - make `IReadOnly` interface that will be used to mark/type objects that are read only
  - have `IMutable` interface that inherits from the readonly interface and has setters. Where you want to object to be modified you specify it with the `IMutable` interface

### The Proxy pattern

- `Context`: It is time consuming and complicated to access instances of a heavyweight classes. How to reduce the need to create instances of heavyweight classes?
- `Solution` (in client-server):
  - Create a proxy class that will be used to access the heavyweight class. The proxy class will have the same interface as the heavyweight class. The proxy will call the server to only get an attribute of the object not the whole object
  - The client deals with the proxy as a local object, the client does not need to get the whole object, it will just call the proxy and the proxy will just return the attribute.

### Factory patter

- `Context`: A reusable framework needs to create objects. However the classes of the created objects depends on the application. We want a framework to create and work with application specific classes and not know about them
- Solution:
  - Create a factory class to create instances of application specific classes
  - The factory is a generic interdface defined in the framework
  - Methods in the interface will be to create subclassess of the application specific classes
